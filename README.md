- 👋 Hi, I am Branimir K. Hackenberger
- 👀 Every day I strive to make ecology, environmental science and biology as quantitative as possible, which for me also means making them more precise, logical and accurate.
- 🌱 I am particularly interested in the application of high performance computing, machine learning, and deep learning to ecology and environmental science.
- 💞️ I am a member of an exceptional team with a wealth of experience and am open to collaboration in all areas of science.
- 📫 If you have any questions, please reach out to me at branimir@buioquant.hr.
